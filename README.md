### \#\#\# 3. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

  * **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * **On macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### \#\#\# 4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install Flask google-generativeai python-dotenv reportlab
```

### \#\#\# 5. Set Up Environment Variables

You need a Google Gemini API key for the AI to work.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
2.  Add your API key to this file:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### \#\#\# 6. Place the PDF Font

For the PDF export to work correctly, you need to add the `DejaVuSans.ttf` font file.

1.  Ensure you have a `static/fonts` directory.
2.  Download the `DejaVuSans.ttf` font and place it inside this directory.

### \#\#\# 7. Run the Application

Start the Flask server with this command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The application should now be running.
